# CONSTITUTION.md

The invariants of this project. Terse by design: rules live here, rationale lives in
`docs/adr/` and `docs/workflow.md`. Changing this file faces the highest scrutiny the
project has (see §Amendment below).

**Status note:** the project is at Phase 0 — only the delivery system exists. Its stack
and domain rules are **not yet decided** — sections marked *(reserved)* will be filled
by ADRs as decisions are ratified.

## 1. Delivery

1. `main` only moves by pull request. No exceptions.
2. Every change enters through the pipeline (`docs/workflow.md` §5): work starts from a
   tracker issue, carries a record riding in its PR, and reaches `main` only by PR with a
   human confirming the merge. Planning, an isolated worktree, and an independent review
   are chosen per task (ADR-001) — except on a protected surface (§3), where a plan and an
   independent review are required. Changes with no semantic content use the no-issue
   path (ADR-001), still merged by PR on a human's confirmation.
3. Git is the system of record for outcomes; the tracker and the forge are the venue for
   process. Which products fill those roles is a mechanical choice made in
   `docs/adapters/` (GitHub for both by default), not a constitutional one. Nothing
   binding exists only in an issue or PR thread — if it isn't merged, it isn't decided.
4. Squash commits are self-contained: goal, non-goals, outcome, and a `Task: #<id>` line
   written from the task record. A no-issue fix (§1.2) has no task or record; its commit
   instead carries the one-line no-semantic-content eligibility statement.
5. Guardrails are never weakened to make work pass. A failing check is fixed by fixing
   the work. Loosening any gate is a protected change (workflow §11.3) with an ADR.

## 2. Decisions

1. One decision per file in `docs/adr/`, numbered, append-only; superseding means a new
   ADR. Every ADR carries rationale, alternatives, and revisit triggers.
2. An ADR is decided by merging its PR with the required approvals. Until then it binds
   nothing.
3. The operative one-line rule for each accepted ADR is added to this file or `AGENTS.md`
   with a pointer to the ADR.

## 3. Protected surfaces

Changes to the following always require a plan, an independent review, and heightened
approval.

**Heightened approval, in the solo phase, is the human's explicit confirmation at
`/t-ship`'s merge gate on a PR that carries a cold review with `readiness: ready`.** That
is the whole of it — there is no separate approval step to look for, and required
approvals on the forge stay at zero because a sole author cannot approve their own PR.
When a second maintainer joins, the bar rises to their approval on the forge as well, and
workflow §13 Q9 decides which surfaces need more than one.

This list has an executable twin: `scripts/protected-paths.sh` decides the same question
for the skills and for CI. The two are one rule in two forms and change in the same task;
where they disagree, that is a defect to fix, not a judgment call to make.

- `CONSTITUTION.md`
- `AGENTS.md` (the session-start contract, and the only home of the check set), together
  with the aliases pointing at it — `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.agents/`, and
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (covered by `.github/` below): repointing an alias
  replaces an agent's whole session-start contract
- `docs/adr/`
- `docs/workflow.md` (the cross-stage rules and §1 principles)
- `.claude/` — the whole directory, not only `.claude/skills/` (the workflow's executable
  form). Sibling files configure the agent that executes it: `.claude/settings.json`
  defines hooks, which run arbitrary shell on tool calls, and permission allowlists;
  `.claude/agents/` defines subagents. Anything that changes what an agent does when it
  runs is as load-bearing as the skills themselves
- `.mcp.json` and `.cursor/` (the same argument, for other agents' executable config)
- `docs/adapters/` (the tracker/forge backend maps the skills execute through)
- `docs/architecture/` (binding conventions the skills execute against)
- `.github/` (CI, CODEOWNERS, rulesets — or the active forge's equivalent config paths,
  `.gitlab-ci.yml` and `.gitlab/`)
- `scripts/` (the mechanical checks and settings-as-code)
- `installer/` (the one-command bootstrap that generates every new project from this
  template — a defect here is inherited by repositories nobody in this one will review)
- `docs/tasks/TEMPLATE.md` and `docs/tasks/README.md` (the shape of every future record —
  the individual records under `docs/tasks/<bucket>/` are not protected)
- `.gitignore` (what it hides never reaches review)
- `README.md` (§3's genesis exception delegates its wording to §Bootstrapping there, so
  that file carries binding content)
- `LICENSE` (the terms everything else in the repository is offered under)

*(reserved: application surfaces — data-privacy paths, contracts, migrations, grants,
audit — to be added when the application exists.)*

**Genesis exception.** A repository started from this template is bootstrapped outside
the pipeline: the placeholder fills named in `README.md` §Bootstrapping and the first
commit are made directly, in that order, before any tracker, PR, or branch protection
exists to route them through. Either route performs genesis — `installer/` doing it in one
command, or a person doing it by hand — and the exception is identical in both: it covers
exactly those placeholder fills and that first commit, and nothing else. **The exception
ends when that first commit is pushed** — one end-point, stated the same way in
`README.md` §Bootstrapping. Every *edit to the tree* after that push goes through the
pipeline, including further edits to those same files. Running
`scripts/github-bootstrap.sh` is not such an edit — it changes settings on the forge and
produces no diff — so it needs no task, before or after the push. The exception never
covers a second round of "just this once".

The exception belongs to the repository being *created*, and covers only its own genesis.
It never covers work on the tooling that creates one: in a repository that ships an
installer, changing that installer is ordinary protected work, planned and reviewed like
any other change to this list.

## 4. Stack & architecture

*(reserved: stack and architecture constraints — add each as a one-line rule here with
a pointer to the ADR that ratified it.)*

## Amendment

- This file changes only by PR at the heightened approval bar, normally alongside an ADR.
- Workflow principles change by ADR; workflow mechanics change by ordinary PR
  (`docs/workflow.md` §11).
