description: Open work — turn the current conversation into tracker issue(s) with the right shape (task, initiative, or initiative with a design child). The only way work starts. Use when a discussion has converged enough that goal and done-when are statable.

# Open work

Turn the conversation into tracker issues. Resolve every `tracker:*` operation named
below via `docs/adapters/TRACKER.md` (GitHub Issues by default). **Issues only** — no branch, no PR, no code,
no record exists after this skill runs. A PR exists only to deliver a diff; coordination
lives entirely in issues.

## Timing

Refuse (politely, with what is missing) if goal and done-when are not yet statable — the
issue bodies would be guesses. Do not wait until everything is settled either; by then
decisions are stranded in chat. The right moment: goal and done-when statable,
decomposition deferred if unclear.

## Procedure

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and `CONSTITUTION.md`.
2. **Shape judgment** — the core of this skill:
   - **Task** — deliverable fits one PR → one issue.
   - **Initiative** — several PRs → a tracking issue plus the child issues that are
     *already clear*, with dependencies.
   - **Initiative, decomposition unknown** → tracking issue plus exactly one child: a
     design task whose merged output determines the rest. Never guess a decomposition at
     open time.
3. Ensure the labels you need exist (`tracker:ensure-labels` for `initiative`, when
   opening a tracking issue).
4. Create the issues (`tracker:create`, title short and imperative).

   Body template (omit empty sections):

   ```markdown
   ## Goal
   <one paragraph, from the conversation — self-sufficient, no chat references>

   ## Done when
   <observable criteria, machine-checkable where possible — a command, a grep, an
   exit code. A criterion only a human can judge is stated as such>

   ## Scope
   <one line: the paths/area this may touch>

   ## Non-goals
   <explicit exclusions; each deferred item gets its own issue, opened now>

   Part of: #<tracking>        (children only)
   Blocked-by: #<id>           (one line per blocker)
   Split from: #<id>           (issues opened from another task's Non-goals)
   ```

   Those three markers are **machine-read** — `/t-work`'s blocker gate, `/t-status`'s
   blocked state, and `/t-cancel`'s dependent, parent, and spun-off sweeps all grep for
   them literally. Write them exactly as shown, one per line, at the end of the body.

   Tracking issues additionally get the `initiative` label and a task-list body
   (`- [ ] #151 …`) instead of Scope.
5. **Deferred** work named in Non-goals is opened as its own issue *now*, holding the
   exclusion rationale and carrying `Split from: #<id>` — the marker that lets
   `/t-cancel` find it if the excluding task is ever abandoned. Without it that sweep has
   nothing to query and degrades to memory.

   Only *deferred* work earns an issue: something the project intends to do later. A
   Non-goal that is simply a boundary — "does not touch billing", "no migration here" —
   is prose in this issue and nothing more. Opening an issue per boundary would make a
   four-exclusion task cost five issues and tax exactly the cheapness the pipeline
   depends on. If it is unclear which kind an exclusion is, ask rather than minting.
6. Report — in plain prose per AGENTS.md §Communication, saying what each issue means in
   ordinary language before any internal terminology: the issue map (numbers, titles,
   dependencies), assumptions made, and the next step. That next step is `/t-plan <id>`
   when the task will touch a protected surface (`CONSTITUTION.md` §3) or its scope needs
   pinning down, and `/t-work <id>` otherwise.

## Rules

- Issues only. Never create a branch, record, or PR here; never write application files.
- Issue bodies must be self-sufficient — a fresh session with no conversation context
  must be able to work the task from the body alone.
- After work starts on a task, intent changes in its record, never in the issue body.
- One deliverable per issue. Three headings of scope = three issues.
- Two working levels only (initiative → task). A child that needs children means the
  initiative should be split.
